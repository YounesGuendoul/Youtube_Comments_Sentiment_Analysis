elizavida,"I don&#39;t understand why some of the songs on this channel, like this one and 100 Band-Aids (Stripped), are so good and touching but are treated coldly and underrated by the majority of us(??   I guess many people only cling to one specific song and don&#39;t even listen to the rest...)😢😢😢"
